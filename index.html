    <p>Hey there! I'm Xavier Hillman. I was born and raised in beautiful Western Massachusetts. I graduated from Westfield High School in 2012 and went straight to the University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth for my undergraduate degree. After switching majors three times, I graduated in 2016 with a degree in Operations Management. Right out of college I started in the aerospace industry in a customer service role before transitioning into project coordination. I then changed industries and have been in real estate for the last three years. I'm currently studying software development at Code Fellows in order to make another career change. I aspire to build some cool income producing projects and one day hope to start a large-scale company.</p>
