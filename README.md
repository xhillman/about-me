### Reflections and Comments

So far, so good. This lab consisted mostly of concepts that I have seen in the past but acted as a good reenforcement of skills I'll continue to utilize moving forward. I've noticed that CSS can be very fickle and although there are many ways to get the desired result, it definitely takes some trial and error to get there. It took me about an hour and a half to complete this assignment which is pretty much what I expected.
