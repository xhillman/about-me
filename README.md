### Reflections and Comments

**7/12/2022** Lab 2
So far, so good. This lab consisted mostly of concepts that I have seen in the past but acted as a good reenforcement of skills I'll continue to utilize moving forward. 

I've noticed that CSS can be very fickle and although there are many ways to get the desired result, it definitely takes some trial and error to get there. It took me about an hour and a half to complete this assignment which is pretty much what I expected.

To add some more complex logic into the program, questions six and seven were added. They incorporate if statements in the same manner as the first five questions but add in some loops to give the user multiple tries to get the question correct.

A `score` variable was also added to tally the total number of questions they get correct.

Additional content was added to the main page to include a list of my favorite marvel characters as well as a reformat of my education and work experience.

CSS continues to be fickle. Without the default properties provided by the browser, it takes a bit more time to get things exactly as you'd like them.

This lab was a bit more difficult than I expected but was able to work through the requirements. I found that laying things out in psuedo-code first was helpful in identifying how certain parts of my loops and if statements needed to be constructed. It took me about two and a half hours to complete this lab which is longer than I anticipated.
